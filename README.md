- [x] _Mint two NFTs with your contract_:heavy_check_mark:
#### <b>3.0 SUBMISSION</b>: 
  For the IPFS links,
  
  _submit a link to the IPFS address, it should start with "ipfs.io"._
  
    My IPFS Address: 
      
  For the ERC20 and ERC721 tokens,
  
  _submit your contract's etherscan address. All contracts must be verified_
  
     My contract's etherscan Address: 

_My Metadata structure details is shown below:_

 ```
 Metadata structure: {
               name : // Any name
               
               image : // URL to image on IPFS,
